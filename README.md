# Python

A growing repository of Python exercises, mini-projects, and experiments as I continue developing my programming skills.

## Coding Challenges (1–5)
1. **Same Values** – A short challenge focused on iterating through lists and identifying matching values by index.  
2. **Reversed List** – A short challenge that tests understanding of list traversal and comparison logic by checking if one list is the reverse of another.  
3. **Thread Shed** – A longer challenge centred on cleaning and processing raw string data, extracting structured information, and performing basic analysis.  
4. **Scrabble** – A longer challenge involving dictionaries, scoring logic, and tracking player points across multiple rounds of a game.  
5. **Reverse** – A short challenge focused on string manipulation and loop-based reversal logic.
> These challenges include **two longer data-focused problems** and **three shorter logic-based exercises**, covering core Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, dictionaries, and data processing.
