# Python

A growing repository of Python exercises, mini-projects, and experiments as I continue developing my programming skills.

## Coding Challenges (1–5)
1. **Same Values** – A short challenge focused on iterating through lists and identifying matching values by index.  
2. **Reversed List** – A short challenge that tests understanding of list traversal and comparison logic by checking if one list is the reverse of another.  
3. **Thread Shed** – A longer challenge centred on cleaning and processing raw string data, extracting structured information, and performing basic analysis.  
4. **Scrabble** – A longer challenge involving dictionaries, scoring logic, and tracking player points across multiple rounds of a game.  
5. **Reverse** – A short challenge focused on string manipulation and loop-based reversal logic.
   These challenges include **two longer data-focused problems** and **three shorter logic-based exercises**, covering core Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, dictionaries, and data processing.

## Coding Challenges (6-10)
6. Substring Between – A short challenge focused on string manipulation and character indexing, extracting substrings between specified delimiters.
7. Check Name – A short challenge centred on string validation and case-insensitive searching to verify if a name exists within a sentence.
8. Make Spoonerism – A short challenge involving string slicing and character swapping logic to create playful word transformations.
9. Transaction Summary Analyzer – A longer challenge focused on data parsing, cleaning unstructured records, and performing multi-level analysis, including totals, averages, and categorization.
10. Inventory Management System – A longer challenge demonstrating object-oriented design with a class-based system for managing products, tracking stock changes, calculating inventory value, and generating professional reports with low-stock warnings.
    These challenges build on core concepts with two longer, real-world focused problems involving data processing and system design, combined with three shorter string and logic manipulation exercises.
